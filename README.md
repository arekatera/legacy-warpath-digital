# Warpath.Digital Legacy
This is the full code I wrote for the O.G Warpath.Digital website. Bulk of it was written within the span of a half to whole week. **Note:** This does not contain any of the assets I used for the website, nor the code for webamp that was originally packaged on the Neocities host. For Webamp you can go to https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp.

Viva la Warpath
