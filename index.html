			<h2 id="sect0">The Start of Something New</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>Warpath was a concept developed by Ferg (Big Ferg L.H) in late 2021 while living with Casper (Young Gho$t) in Lyall Bay, after their previous flat was lost to a kitchen fire. During this time, Ferg reacquainted themselves with the new wave of underground Jungle and Drum & Bass, scenes he had not paid attention to for years. Ferg had been a passionate fan of both genres since the age of 11, though in recent years his attention had shifted towards other styles like Metal, Hardcore, Hip Hop, 140, and Byzantine Chant.<br>
				<br>The idea for Warpath primarily came from Ferg watching videos of the Rupture London raves on Youtube and where he immediately thought “We need something like this in Wellington!”. Despite being a smaller city, Wellington is blessed to be home to a vibrant underground music scene, with genres like Psy-Trance, DnB, 140/Dubstep, and Garage/Breaks regularly filling up the gig calendar. There's also a wide-ranging Hip Hop scene, a dedicated Noise scene, an ever-growing Indie scene, and, of course, the close-knit 04 HARDCORE community.
				<br><br>Throughout all of this noise, Ferg had noticed that there was a lack of dedicated Jungle nights, with jungle generally being played as an afterthought. Usually reserved for the end of the night to hype the punters up, or featured as occasional classics in sets dominated by other genres.
				<br><br>Efforts to bring Warpath to life were mostly dormant throughout 2022, a year where Ferg was overwhelmed by academic pressures, personal conflicts, difficult landlords, and struggles with mental health. However, things changed over New Year's when Ferg met Ethan (Arekatera) at the Twisted Frequency festival, where they were both working shifts at an Italian pizza pop-up. The chaotic atmosphere, fueled by intoxicated customers, made for a hilarious experience. Staying at the same campsite, and sharing similar interests in music and internet subcultures, the two naturally became friends.
				<br><br>After Twisted, Ferg and Ethan briefly worked together again at a prominent Wellington billstickering company. It was here that Ferg asked Ethan if he wanted to help make Warpath a reality. With aligned visions on aesthetics, promotion, and a shared DIY spirit, the two immediately set to work…</p>

			<h2>27th of April 2023 - Volume REDACTED</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>As anyone from Wellington city can tell you, one of the go to bars for hosting underground gigs is Valhalla. With both Ferg and Ethan sharing a deep love of the venue, as well as Ferg personally knowing the owner Ben from being a regular, it was only natural for Valhalla to host the very first edition of Warpath / Warpath Jungle. Upon making this decision, Ferg hit up Ben and they were given their very first date as promoters: Thursday, April 27th.
				<br><br>This was when Ferg and Ethan first cracked down to develop the concept for what the aesthetics of Warpath were going to be. Ferg, from the very get go, was insistent on a dark and militant approach for the aesthetic direction of Warpath. Our first poster was this idea in full force, a mix of freedom fighters / terrorists (depending on your political stance) and war movie imagery was used. Ferg shared this design with friends within the 04HC community and it was quickly met with praise, however, we were soon to learn that this less censored style of marketing was something unique to the HC scene.
				<br><br>For this first date, there were two other DJs on the night. Young Gho$t and Unwell; both being massive fans of Jungle, amazing artists/DJs, as well as good friends, it only made sense to have them on. However, upon showing them the poster, we were immediately met with backlash. With both DJs not wanting their names to be on such an edgy poster, Ferg and Ethan knew they had to tone down the edginess ten fold if they were to make Warpath something that is taken seriously. 
				<br><br>Soon after this minor disagreement between those playing on the night, Ben informed Ferg that there was a double booking for April 27th, and since we had not started our promotion and the other night had, we were going to be moved. This new date would be: Wednesday, May 25th. </p>

			<h2>25th of May 2023 - Volume I</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>Due to the date change, we were no longer able to host the DJs we had originally planned for, and the planning for the night was put off for a couple weeks as Ethan was busy between work and DJing a couple Hip Hop gigs for rapper Dirty Mike. This was when, by a complete moment of chance, Ethan met another jungle DJ, in the backseat of Dirty Mike’s car. <br><br>
				The DJ was Shampez (Mako). Hailing from the UK, now living in Wellington, literally having ORIGINAL JUNGLIST proudly tattooed upon his chest, as well as being a vinyl only DJ with a large backlog of events they had played at back it the UK, it was nothing but obvious that Mako was a perfect fit for the jungle night. After some conversation, Ethan and Mako made tentative plans for him to play, which were later confirmed after Ethan spoke to Ferg about the encounter.
				<br><br>The last step to completion was finalizing the poster for the night. After the mixed feelings on the last poster, Ethan knew that they had to achieve the dark and militant theme through other means. For years now, Ethan had compiled a wide range of “hard images” onto his phone and immediately one sprang to mind: an image of this man in a homemade ziptied Iron Man suit. This embodied exactly what Warpath was about to Ethan. It showcased the D.I.Y nature of the event via the very obviously homemade armor, as well as the militant side as the suit drew a strong resemblance to gundam battle mechs. Finally, through inspiration from local poster design, as well as poster design from the American Breakcore and Digital-Hardcore scenes, Ethan settled on the thresholded look for the poster. 
				<br><br>The night had a modest turnout but it was the start of something new. Many of the people who came to that first night became regulars of Warpath, still going to this day. This was also where Ferg had properly connected with the local legend that is Splash, aka Manaia Toa. After this interaction Ferg knew he had to ask Splash to play, as they were one of the OG’s of the Aotearoa DnB/Jungle scene.
				<br><br>The day after the event, VJs Cubeman and Raskal (Rachie) shared their praise with Ethan when he passed by their exhibition at Thistle Hall. Just as Ferg felt about Splash, Ethan felt the same drive to involve Cubeman and Raskal, as both were legends in the VJ scene. Warpath was quickly gaining momentum.

			<h2>2nd of August 2023 - Volume II</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>Much to our delight—and to our surprise—our first event’s success allowed us to do it all over again. Not only were we able to pay everyone working on the night well, but we also made enough to fund another event with some added extras. After receiving such high praise from Shampez, Splash, Cubeman, and Rachie, we knew we had to bring them back. To our excitement, all four were keen to get involved.<br><br>
				this second round, we kicked things off with Shampez once again, whose vinyl-only set immediately set the tone for the night with some heavy jungle vibes. Following up was Manaia Toa (Splash), a legend in the local DnB and jungle scene, who tore and educated the crowd with a set featuring some of the most militant stuff Manaia Toa had on offer (I remember him mentioning how back in the 90s these tracks would clear dancefloors, and how refreshing it was to see them do the opposite). Finally, Ferg and I closed out the night with our signature dark and militant sound, pushing the energy to its peak.<br><br>
				The vibe of the night was strong, and Cubeman captured some incredible moments on camera, which you can find displayed on our events page. Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen events Rachie wasn’t able to make it on this night, however the visuals from Cubeman were, as always, absolutely stunning, enhancing the atmosphere of every track. <br><br>
				As for the poster design, we decided to lean into the rich history of jungle music with a playful twist. Inspired by the Pokémon Blastoise and its prior evolution, Wartortle, the idea behind this design fit our Warpath theme perfectly—"WAR" tortle, get it? The mix of nostalgic gaming imagery with our signature militant style was the perfect fit for this event.<br><br>
				The turnout was strong, and many of the regulars from the first event returned, solidifying our growing community. Warpath was quickly becoming more than just a gig—it was a movement.

			<h2>4th of October 2023 - Volume III</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>After Rachie (VJ Raskal) was unable to make it for Warpath Jungle 2, we had to get her back on board for Warpath Jungle 3. This time, she went all out, delivering a freaky, mind-bending set of visuals. Layering nude images of people from all walks of life with trippy, hallucinogenic effects, Rachie created an experience that completely boggled the mind. Her visuals danced in perfect chaos with the music, turning the night into a true sensory overload. It was a unique and unsettling twist that set this event apart.<br><br>
				With the majority of our core Warpath lineup now established, the stage was set with familiar faces: Shampez (Mako) opening the night with his vinyl-only jungle mastery, Manaia Toa (Splash) delivering another iconic set, and Ferg and I closing things out with our signature dark, militant sounds. The energy on the floor was buzzing just as much as the previous event, with light whips flashing through the crowd, adding another surreal layer to the night.<br><br>
				The turnout was strong once again, with many of the same faces returning along with some new, unexpected additions. The Warpath community was growing steadily, with each event adding new layers to our underground movement.<br><br>
				But the final piece of the Warpath Jungle puzzle found us purely by chance, once again. This time, it was Paul, aka P-S-I (Pounds per Square Inch), who caught our attention. After giving us immense praise for the night, we discovered Paul was a jungle DJ as well. There was no question—we had to get him on board for the next event. With every piece falling into place, Warpath was quickly evolving into something far greater than we had ever imagined.

			<h2>14th of October 2023 - Volume IV</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>Just a few weeks after our last event, we found ourselves at Auntie Social, a cozy yet vibrant spot nestled right on the main Newtown strip, opposite Café Laz. The place had this lush, decadent vibe, with its red velvet-covered walls making it feel almost like a secret club. Sadly, Auntie Social has since closed down, becoming yet another casualty of Wellington's constantly shifting nightlife scene. Rest in peace, Auntie Social—you’ll be missed, but never forgotten.<br><br>
			This night, Warpath brought the fire once again. The venue may have been small, but it filled up quick. We had the light whip crew come back, bringing a whole new dynamic to the already electric atmosphere. For this gig, our good mate Andrew pulled through and helped us out by working the door, which was a massive help in keeping things flowing smoothly.<br><br>
			One of the biggest highlights of the night was finally getting Paul (aka P-S-I) on the decks, spinning under the Warpath banner for the first time. Paul delivered exactly what we knew he would—absolute jungle mayhem. Unfortunately, due to some miscommunication with the venue, we had to cut the night short by about an hour, which led to Ethan sacrificing most of his own set to make sure everyone else got their time behind the decks. It was a real "for the love of the scene" moment, but that’s just how we roll.<br><br>
			This gig also marked a major milestone for us—it was the debut of the Warpath Sound System. Our humble little setup, consisting of a mix between Warfdale and Peavey gear, might not have looked like much, but it packed a punch. Even Paul, who hails from the legendary Third Eye Hi-Fi soundsystem, was impressed by what we managed to pull off with it. The night may have ended earlier than expected, but it was nothing short of a success.

			<h2>2nd of February 2024 - Volume V</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>After a few months of much-needed downtime over the new year, we came back swinging with Warpath Jungle Vol V, returning to the legendary Valhalla. This time around, we had some exciting new additions that made the night stand out—Knifedge took charge of the visuals, bringing a whole new level of intensity to the event. The inclusion of Art Vandelay for a special all-vinyl set was another major highlight. Art Vandelay's reputation for insane vinyl mixing skills preceded them, and they absolutely delivered. Their set was militant and hardcore, every track hitting like a sledgehammer, with seamless transitions that left everyone in awe.<br><br>
				We knew the night would be something special when we saw a push pit break out during Art Vandelay’s and Manaia Toa's sets—something you almost never see at an electronic gig in Wellington. It felt like the energy was contagious, spreading through the crowd and pushing the boundaries of what a jungle night could be.<br><br>
				This gig also marked another milestone for Warpath, as we unveiled our very first batch of Warpath Jungle-themed T-shirts. To our surprise and delight, they sold out almost immediately. We also started receiving numerous requests for posters, which we didn’t have available that night but promised for the next event. <br><br>
				Warpath Jungle Vol V truly set the tone for what was to come—bigger, harder, and more unforgettable with every event.

			<h2>15th of June 2024 - Volume VI</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>Warpath Jungle VI was, without a doubt, the peak of everything we had achieved so far. For the first time, we had the budget to go all out and bring in the Full Cubeman Experience. Known for his intricate visual setups, Cubeman arrived with a massive screen net that stretched across the front of the stage, coupled with his signature projector screen behind the DJs. Using dual projectors, one beaming onto the net in front and the other behind the stage, Cubeman created an unforgettable visual depth. The DJs appeared as though they were trapped inside a glitching, futuristic TV screen, shifting between channels. It was trippy and utterly mesmerizing, leaving everyone in the room buzzing with awe.<br><br>
				This event also marked a milestone for Warpath as we hosted our first out-of-town artist. Hailing from Christchurch, 19-year-old DJ and producer Caspian headlined the night. Despite his young age, Caspian commanded the decks with a level of professionalism beyond his years, ripping through a set that shook Valhalla to its core. A special highlight was seeing his uncle jump on stage during the set to MC over the beats, adding a family touch that made the night even more special.<br><br>
				The MC energy didn't stop there. During Ferg's set, our close friend Tallulah took the mic and began weaving in powerful Māori karakias and revolutionary rhetoric, calling on the crowd to rise up and fight for their rights. The combination of Tallulah's intense words and the militant tracks Ferg was spinning created an atmosphere that was absolutely unmatched. It was the kind of moment that makes you realize the power of music and community.<br><br>
				And of course, Shampez and Ferg brought their usual fire to the microphone. There was even a brief but full-circle moment during Ethan's set, where Dirty Mike—the very person who had introduced Ethan to Shampez—hopped up to perform, much to the crowd's delight. Shampez, as always, was at the heart of the energy, encouraging Mike to take the stage, closing the loop on how Warpath Jungle started in that fateful car ride.<br><br>
				All in all, Warpath Jungle VI was the culmination of everything we'd been building toward: mind-blowing visuals, next-level music, and an unbeatable vibe.<br><br>
				Note: To this day, Ferg and Ethan have continually felt honored by the love and everyone who has worked on Warpath, as well as all the punters that show up in full force every gig. All of your contributions have been invaluable, and we are grateful to you all as part of the Warpath journey. We love y’all. <3

			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>Warpath Wednesdays was our way of branching out from jungle and hardcore, giving local DJs a space to explore different genres and sounds without the commercial pressures that stifle creativity. From the very beginning, we envisioned these nights as a space where artists could play exactly what they wanted—no restrictions, no expectations—just pure passion and love for their craft.<br><br>
				For these shows, we also wanted to mix up our DJ roster and keep the lineup fresh, so we scouted the Wellington scene, looking for artists who embodied the Warpath vibe. For the first Warpath Wednesday, we invited Birkenthot (Caitlin), a legendary figure in the Wellington underground, and Nymphloads (Josiah), a friend of Ethan's who had a unique and eclectic approach to Baile Funk—a genre both Ferg and Ethan were obsessed with.<br><br>
				The night started off with Ferg, who prepared a halftime set, setting a deep, atmospheric mood. Then came Josiah, whose Baile Funk set had everyone moving. At one point, the CDJs glitched, which was disappointing, but instead of letting it kill the vibe, Ethan jumped in with a classic Baile Funk beatbox, with the crowd joining in by chanting “toma toma toma” and “Vai!” It turned into an impromptu acapella jam session that kept the energy going. Thankfully, Caitlin, being a tech wizard, quickly fixed the issue, and the set resumed in full force.<br><br>
				Next, Ethan tore into an hour of high-energy Happy Hardcore and Gabber, blending old-school and new-school tracks, keeping the energy relentless with pounding 4-on-the-floor kick drums. To close the night, Caitlin delivered a ruthless set of Frenchcore and Hardtek, leaving no one standing still as she hammered out relentless beats that shook the dancefloor.<br><br>
				We also had the honor of having KITTY on visuals for the night. They set up a dual screen system on either side of the DJs, projecting iconic Warpath imagery alongside stunning artwork by the legendary Wellington artist and close friend of Warpath, Jordi (@grinderoffools). The visuals were mesmerizing, creating a kaleidoscope of chaos and beauty that perfectly matched the night's energy.<br><br>
				Despite a massive response to the event page on Facebook, with over 150 people indicating they were coming, biblical-level flooding at Valhalla cut our numbers down. Even with the smaller crowd, the vibe was incredible. The dancefloor remained packed all night, and the extra space allowed for more freedom to move and dance harder. Warpath Wednesdays kicked off with a bang, setting the stage for what would become a series of unforgettable nights.

			<h2>27th of April 2024 - Volume II</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>After the incredible success of the first Warpath Wednesday, we knew we had to do it again—this time, with a fresh lineup of artists we were eager to showcase. We called on our friends and fellow promoters, gathered feedback through Warpath's Instagram story, and landed on a stacked roster featuring Stacey Lee, Current Bias, Miracle Bunny $upport, and Young Gho$t.<br><br>
				This time, Ethan decided to take on VJ duties, creating visuals with a software-based visual synth that layered CRT glitch effects with old web GIFs. The visual content came from assets that would eventually be used for this very website. However, due to technical limitations with Ferg's borrowed laptop, the software couldn't handle the load for the entire night. The first few sets had the stunning glitch visuals, but when the laptop gave out, we quickly pivoted to the classic Windows pole screensaver on loop. After a while, local photographer Jechtography, who was documenting the event, came to the rescue. He set up his PSVita into OBS, running emulated old-school games, which fit the night's vibe perfectly.<br><br>
				The music kicked off with Miracle Bunny $upport (Ruby), who threw down a blistering set featuring a mix of Dariacore, Happy Hardcore, Bubblegum Bass, Hyperpop, and Brostep. From the very first track, the dancefloor erupted, and the energy stayed electric all night long. Next up was the legend Stacey Lee (Josh), who brought an incredible mix of Breaks and Electro, shaking the room and keeping the crowd in a trance.<br><br>
				Current Bias (Jackie) took the decks afterward, delivering a genre-bending journey from Jungle to Syntty to more experimental tracks, weaving an intricate auditory story that mesmerized the entire crowd. <br><br>
				Unfortunately, Young Gho$t couldn't make it due to unforeseen personal issues, but Ferg quickly stepped in to find a replacement. To everyone's surprise, he pulled Noyer from his birthday party down the road at Rogue and Vagabond. Even better, Noyer brought scene legends Lakeboon and Wobble Daddy, and together, they delivered an incredible B2B set that blew the roof off with their high-energy selections.<br><br>
				With some time left after the B2B set, Ferg and Ethan jumped on to close out the night with their signature militant styles. The crowd, still buzzing with energy, danced like maniacs right until the final track. The night was pure chaos, and in the best possible way—another milestone for Warpath.<br><br>
				Warpath Wednesday Vol 2 cemented itself as a highlight in our series, showcasing new talent, unexpected surprises, and a vibe that was unmatched.

			<h2>June 1st 2024 - Start Today x Warpath All Ages Show</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>Ferg’s journey into gigging started with all-ages shows, so it has always been a priority for him to give back by continuing to throw these events. The goal was to provide the next generation with the same musical opportunities that he had. After organizing numerous all-ages hardcore gigs with the Start Today crew, it only made sense to collaborate on an all-ages show with Warpath.<br><br>
				However, the lead-up to this event was during an incredibly busy time for both Ferg and Ethan, which led to some stagnation in promotion. We initially planned to hit up as many high schools across Wellington as possible, distributing posters to libraries and classrooms. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, our promotion was limited to a single poster campaign focused mainly on Taranaki Street, conveniently located next to Wellington High.<br><br>
				As a result of the more limited outreach, the crowd was smaller than we had hoped, but the vibe was still electric. The attendees made up for the low numbers with pure enthusiasm, dancing hard and throwing down mosh moves to our electronic beats. The energy was intimate and contagious, turning the night into something special despite the turnout.<br><br>
				A highlight of the night was the surprise guest appearance of P-S-I, who joined Ferg and Ethan for an impromptu B2B session. Together, they took turns playing four tracks each, bringing variety and spontaneity to the set and elevating the energy even further.<br><br>
				We were also lucky to have photographer Mak AKA Disposable Belief pull up with some of his close friends to document the night. His photos captured the raw energy of the event and can be seen on our events page, giving everyone a glimpse of the vibe we created.<br><br>
				Looking back, this event reminded us of the importance of promotion, especially for all-ages shows. Though the turnout was smaller, the dedication and passion of those who attended left a lasting impression. Moving forward, we’re committed to returning to the idea of all-ages raves in Wellington, but next time we’ll go all-in on promotion to make sure the event gets the attention it deserves.<br><br>
				This collab with Start Today was a learning experience, and we’re excited to build on it in the future.

			<h2>2nd of August 2024 - Third Eye Hi-Fi and Warpath Jungle presents: Amen Sessions 002</h2>
			<div class="sectFlex">
				<p>In a natural progression from our growing network, we had the opportunity to collaborate with Third Eye Hi-Fi for their dedicated jungle night, Amen Sessions. Thanks to our newfound friend and regular Warpath Jungle crew member, Paul, we set out to bring the power of jungle music to the people of Newtown, all through Third Eye Hi-Fi's legendary sound system.<br><br>
				The lineup was a fantastic mix of talent, featuring Birkenthot, Intec, and P-S-I from Third Eye, alongside Warpath's own Arekatera (Ethan) and Big Ferg L.H. (Ferg). We were also thrilled to have special guest Zuke join us, delivering an electrifying set that captivated the audience.<br><br>
				While we were excited about the night, the turnout was not as high as we had hoped, with approximately 70 attendees. Given the various other gigs happening that weekend and the financial challenges posed by the ongoing recession, we weren't surprised or disheartened. Instead, we focused on the incredible experience we were creating together.<br><br>
				The night turned out to be a valuable opportunity for building connections and friendships within the community. Despite the lower turnout, the atmosphere was vibrant and supportive, embodying the essence of what Warpath and Third Eye Hi-Fi stand for: uniting people through music.<br><br>
				This collaboration not only enriched our understanding of the jungle scene but also reinforced the importance of community in these challenging times. We look forward to many more collaborations that bring people together, and we’re excited to see how these connections will shape future events.
